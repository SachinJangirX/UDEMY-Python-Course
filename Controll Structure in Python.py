## QUESTION TO TAKE INPUTS AND GIVE THE ASKED OPERATOR VALUES 
# a = int(input('Enter Operand1: '))
# b = int(input('Enter Operand2: '))
# operator = input('Enter operator(+,-,*,/): ')

# if(operator == '+'):
#     print(a+b)
# elif(operator == '-'):
#     print(a-b)
# elif(operator == '*'):
#     print(a*b)
# elif(operator == '/'):
#     print(a/b)
# else:
#     print('!!!Enter the correct operator!!!')

#  RANGE FUNCTION

# n = list(range(10))    --> this one creates a list of 10 values with start = 0 and end = 9
#  o/p -> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# we could also give the start value as list(range(2,8)) --> [2,3,4,5,6,7] 
# general formula = list(range(start_value, end_value, step_size))


# FOR LOOPS 

# l = [list of iteams || could be of diff like int, str, float, double, bool]
# for x in l:               x -> variable name for each item        l -> name of the list
#     print(x)


# WHILE LOOPS

# while(txt_expression):
#     statement
#     increament/decreament


# counter = 1
# while(counter<6):
#     print('a')
#     counter+=1

# if we are working with the decrementing ones then pick the higher value of counter and then decrease it till it matches with false ones
